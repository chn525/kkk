Liverpool will be looking to maintain their excellent record against Belgian opposition when they take on Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.
The Jupiler Pro League champions are set to be the club's 130th different European opponent and the 77th in this competition.
The Reds have earned 10 wins, two draws and suffered a single defeat in previous contests with teams from Belgium, having faced Anderlecht, Club Brugge and Standard Liege. The only reverse came at the hands of Anderlecht in the first leg of the 1978 European Super Cup as Bob Paisley's side lost 3-1.
