 Marcus Rashford's first-half strike was cancelled out as Manchester United battled to a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday.
 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side took the lead shortly before the break, as Marcus slotted home a brilliant cross from Daniel James, and there was relief for the home fans soon after, as the visitors had a Sadio Mane goal chalked off by VAR, after the Senagal international handled the ball in the build-up.
 Despite a spirited performance from the home side in the second half, Liverpool snatched an equaliser with five minutes to go, as Adam Lallana converted Andrew Robertson's cross to rescue a point.
